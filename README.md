# NDP-Kmeans
This is for "K-means clustering with natural density peaks for discovering arbitrary-shaped clusters"
In the source code, NDP_Kmeans.m is the code of the proposed algoirhtm
NDP_Searching.m is Algorithm 1
KmeanWithGD.m is Algorithm 3 (including Algorithm 2) 
drawcluster_ndpkmeans.m is used to draw the clustering results
In datasets.zip, we give the synthetic datasets used in our paper. The real datasets can obtained from UCI.
